Sydney Thunder vs Brisbane Heat, 24th Match(Sydney VS Brisbane) 8th January 2019


The down of a new year directs to perhaps a change in fortunes for some and Brisbane Heat will be hoping for the same as they aim to restart a wayward BBL campaign as they take on the Sydney Sixers, who come off a resounding win against a formidable Renegades side. With a belter of a pitch on offer at the Carrara Oval, 2019 could not have a better match to get underway.
